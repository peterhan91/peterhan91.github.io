I am a PhD student at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1) in Aachen, Germany, working on machine learning research. 

My doctoral research concentrated mostly on implicit generative models, adversarial invariant features, and federated learning methods for [computer-assisted diagnostics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_diagnosis). 
Passionately, I generate complex, high-dimensional radiological data to accurately predict the [progression of diseases](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00560-x). 
My goal is to address challenges of broad clinical relevance, to develop approaches that are both precise and successful, and to construct intelligent systems that can improve our lives.

Before beginning my PhD, I graduated with distinction, i.e., mit Auszeichnung, from RWTH Aachen University in [Physics](https://www.physik.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~mya/physik/?lidx=1). 
In my Master's thesis, I estimated relaxation parameters from rapid Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting measurements using Machine Learning techniques.
